# Proof by Cases

Book shows the example of:

Every collection of 6 people includes a club of 3 people or a group of 3 strangers.

A club is a group where every pair of people have met. 

Strangers is a group where every pair of people have not met. 

Book says to denote x as one of the 6 people and to separate into subcases. 

Each of those initial sub cases also separates into 2 sub cases each. 

# Proof by Contradiction

Always a viable approach but a bit convoluted, so direct is better. 

1. We use proof by contradiction.
2. Suppose P is false.
3. Deduce something known to be false (a logical contradiction).
4. This is a contradiction. Therefore, P must be true. 

Book example is proving that sq rt of 2 is irrational. It starts with assuming sq rt of 2 is rational. Says we can then write sq rt of 2 as a fraction n divided by d in lowest terms. 

But then you square both sides and see 2 = n squared div d squared. And see that if 2 times d squared is equal to n squared, n must be a multiple of 2. Then n squared must be a multiple of 4. And 2dsquared is a multiple of 4 as well, and so d squared must be a multiple of 2. And now we see that both numerator and denominator have 2 as a common factor, so it's NOT in lowest terms. 

Can't be rational. 

It's irrational. 

# Good Proofs in Practice

1. State your game plan. Say what your method is gonna be.
2. Linear. Don't jump everywhere. 
3. A proof is an essay. 
4. Don't toss in symbols everywhere--use English if you can. 
5. Revise and simplify.
6. Notation, but thoughtfully. Define what new stuff you use. 
7. Structure long proofs like a program. Prove those preliminary lemmas then use them. If you're repeating the same argument over and over, capture it in a general lemma. 
8. Beware the obvious. AKA don't say shit's clear if it isn't. 
9. Finish. Tie it all together.
