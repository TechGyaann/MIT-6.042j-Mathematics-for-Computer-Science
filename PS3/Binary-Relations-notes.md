# Binary Relation

Are two variables with assigned values equal? Is one bigger than the other? Do they have a common divisor? Is the first a member of the second if the second's a set? Is the first the domain of the second if the first is a set and the second is a function? How are they RELATED???? 

These are examples of binary relations. 

Let's get ready to think about some terminology and then some EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS and PARTIAL ORDERS.

## Relations and Functions

Def 1.1:
A binary relation R consists of:
- a set A called the domain of R, 
- a set B called the codomain of R, and
- a subset of A X B called the graph of R. 

Example: "is teaching relation". 
Domain is the names of all the teaching staff.
Codomain is equal to all the subject numbers in the current catalogue. 

Graph looks like
{(Teacher A, 6.042), (Teacher B, 18.062), (Teacher A, 18.062), (Teacher C, 6.046)}

and et cetrea. 

Look, Def 1.1 is the same as a definition of a function, except that it doesn't require that for each domain element there's at most one pair in the graph that has that domain element as its first coordinate. 

A function is a special case of a binary relation.
