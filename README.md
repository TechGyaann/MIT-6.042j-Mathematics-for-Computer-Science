# MIT-6.042j-Mathematics-for-Computer-Science

This course is like a gentle general math intro. Looks like it covers proofs, set theory, and some probability theory. I know jack shit about these topics so let's dive in!

Some aspects of proofs remind me vaguely of SML. Defining types and functions and then being able to use them in other functions is kind of like defining terms and making lemmas to prove something. Maybe there's not that much relation but that's kind of neat. 

## Inner voice of doubt

I was in a state of simultaneous excitement and hesitation when it came to this course. I was excited to learn a bit of basic math in order to have a clearer understanding of the underpinnings of computer science. I was also fearful that perhaps it was not the best use of my time. Some people (and perhaps I have a friend or two who thinks this way) would say that this course is useless for furthering my software engineering skills. It has no immediate application. Plenty of excellent software engineers exist who might say that they have never had to think about math after college. 

I guess in the end, it's really about what I want. I think it would be nice to fill in the gaps of my knowledge. Even if I don't ever end up making use of this stuff, I can't imagine that it would make me a worse person to know it (and surely the opportunity cost is not so high as to make this a bad choice). 

I don't know if I'll finish this course but I will chew through some of it as long as I feel like doing so.
